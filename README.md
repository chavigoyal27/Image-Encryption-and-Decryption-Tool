# Image Encryption and Decryption Tool
This project provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application for encrypting and decrypting JPEG images using a basic XOR encryption method. The application is built using Python and Tkinter.
## Features
### Select Image File: 
Allows the user to select a JPEG image file from their file system.
### Encrypt/Decrypt Image: 
Encrypts or decrypts the selected image using an XOR encryption key provided by the user.
## Prerequisites
1) Python 3.x
2) Tkinter (usually included with Python standard library)
## Usage
### Run the Application
Execute the image_encryption_decryption_tool.py script to launch the GUI.
### Select an Image
Click the "Encrypt/Decrypt" button. A file dialog will appear.
Select the JPEG image file you want to encrypt or decrypt.
### Enter Encryption/Decryption Key
In the text entry box, enter the encryption/decryption key (a numeric value).
### Encrypt/Decrypt the Image
Click the "Encrypt/Decrypt" button. The selected image will be encrypted or decrypted and saved with the same name.
